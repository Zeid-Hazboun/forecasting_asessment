I was given an assignment by a company I was interviewing for. The assignment itself can be found below, with all the code/explanation can be found in the notebook.

## The Assessment

The goal of the assessment is to forecast product sales for a small set of products. This is a basic test of your ability to work with data in Python, to train machine learning models, and generate predictions. We will primarily be assessing your coding, thinking, and processes, and not the details of the machine learning applied.
 
Attached is a CSV file containing historic sales for 3 products. The assessment has two parts:
Using the provided historic dataset, train model(s) to forecast the 3 products. You are free in your choice of tools as long as it is written in Python.

Produce a 6-month forecast using your model(s) for each product. Also, include code/pseudocode for how you would measure the accuracy of this forecast based on actual data. You are free to choose your own accuracy measures, as there is no one right answer here. We are most interested in your reasoning for what would be a good measure.
